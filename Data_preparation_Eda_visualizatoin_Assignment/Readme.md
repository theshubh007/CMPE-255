# Data preparation, eda, visualizatoin assignment

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning assignment focusing on two distinct datasets:

1. Airbnb New York City Listings 2019 (Tabular Data)
2. Air Quality in India (Time Series Data)


## Objectives

- Conduct in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Perform thorough data preprocessing and cleaning
- Apply clustering and anomaly detection techniques
- Implement feature engineering and selection strategies
- Develop and evaluate machine learning models using AutoML techniques

## Part 1: Airbnb NYC 2019 Dataset Analysis

### Dataset
[The Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) provides a rich, tabular dataset with diverse feature types, ideal for demonstrating various data analysis and machine learning techniques.

### Key Analyses
- Detailed EDA with visualizations of listing distributions, pricing trends, and geographical patterns
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
- Clustering analysis to identify distinct listing groups
- Anomaly detection to isolate unusual listings
- Feature engineering to create meaningful predictors
- AutoML model building for price prediction

## Part 2: Air Quality in India Time Series Analysis

### Dataset
The [Air Quality in India dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india) offers a time series perspective, allowing for the application of specialized time series analysis techniques.

### Key Analyses
- Time series visualization and decomposition
- Trend and seasonality analysis
- Handling of missing data in a time series context
- Feature engineering specific to time series data
- Time series forecasting using both traditional and machine learning approaches

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of an image compression application using GitHub Copilot for code assistance. The app is designed to reduce the file size of images while maintaining acceptable quality. Unit tests were also implemented to ensure the reliability of the application.

## Features

- Image compression functionality
- Support for multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG)
- Adjustable compression levels
- User-friendly interface via a web application

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- GitHub Copilot for code assistance
- FastAPI for web framework
- Pillow (PIL) for image processing
- pytest for unit testing


## Unit Testing

Unit tests were implemented using pytest to ensure the reliability and correctness of the image compression functionality.

- Compression of JPEG image formats
- Verification of file size reduction
- Preservation of image quality within acceptable limits
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Correct functioning of the download feature for compressed images

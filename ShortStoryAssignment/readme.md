## **Key Innovations**
The researchers introduced two practical contributions to enhance the LDA algorithm’s performance:

- Topic Score (ρ): Measures the density of significant financial tags in a topic.
- LDA Score Threshold (δ): Filters for truly relevant content, improving precision.

## **Conclusion**
This groundbreaking NLP system represents a significant step forward in automating financial news analysis. By combining advanced text segmentation, topic modeling, and temporal analysis techniques, it offers investors a powerful tool to cut through information overload and focus on what matters most.

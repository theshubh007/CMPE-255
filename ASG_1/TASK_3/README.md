# TASK 3: Auto ML with JadBio

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning classification task using JadBio, a zero-code AutoML platform. The goal is to predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit plan based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about bank customers and their likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit plan.

## Tools Used

- **AutoML Platform**: JadBio
- **Dataset Source**: Kaggle

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Import**: The bank customer dataset was uploaded to JadBio.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: JadBio automatically handled data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
3. **Feature Selection**: The platform identified the most relevant features for the prediction task.
4. **Model Training**: Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics were generated to assess model accuracy.


## Key Features

- Zero-code implementation
- Automated feature selection and engineering
- Multiple model comparisons
- Easy-to-understand performance metrics


## Results

The project successfully created a classification model to predict term deposit subscriptions. Detailed results and model performance can be viewed in the JadBio platform.

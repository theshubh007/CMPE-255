# CMPE 255 - Assignment 1: 

# TASK 1: Code with Python

## Overview

This assignment focuses on implementing Python code examples from Derek Banas' Python tutorial and exploring advanced Google Colab features. The project is structured as a Jupyter notebook in Google Colab, demonstrating various Python concepts and Colab functionalities.

## Contents

1. **Derek Banas Python Tutorial Implementation**

   - Basic Python syntax
   - Data types and structures
   - Control flow (if statements, loops)
   - Functions and modules
   - Object-Oriented Programming concepts
   - File I/O operations
   - Exception handling

2. **Advanced Google Colab Features**
   - Interactive widgets
   - Data visualization techniques
   - Integration with external services (e.g., Google Drive)
   - Using GPU acceleration
   - Collaborative editing and sharing

## How to Use

1. Open the [CMPE_255_Asg1.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K0_W4Z5WIrd6oiifX__EGYB3R4cNoOx6?usp=sharing) file in Google Colab.

2. Run the cells sequentially to see the implementation of Python concepts and Colab features.
3. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to enhance your understanding.

## Requirements

- Google account for accessing Google Colab
- Basic understanding of Python programming

## Data Science Methodologies Project
This repository contains three comprehensive data science projects, each following a different methodology: CRISP-DM, SEMMA, and KDD. The projects demonstrate the application of these methodologies to solve real-world problems using various datasets.

### Project Structure
The repository is organized into three main directories, each corresponding to a specific methodology:
* CRISP-DM_Employee_Classification
* SEMMA_Restaurant_Cuisine_Classification
* KDD_Spam_Email_Classification

### 1. CRISP-DM: Employee Classification
This project uses the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to classify employees based on various attributes. The goal is to predict employee attrition and identify factors that contribute to employee retention.
#### Dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawfikelmetwally/employee-dataset/data
#### Medium Article: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackksoncsie/spam-email-dataset
### Key Features:
* Follows all six phases of CRISP-DM
* Employs multiple classification algorithms
* Provides insights into employee attrition factors.

### 2. SEMMA: Restaurant Cuisine Classification
This project applies the SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess) methodology to classify restaurant cuisines based on menu items and other characteristics.
Dataset: Restaurant dataset (source not specified in the notebook)
#### Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/dhruvb99/resturant-rating-predictor
#### Medium Article: https://medium.com/@shubhamkothiya007/restaurant-cuisine-classification-a-data-science-approach-using-semma-methodology-4e65d1547aef
### Key Features:
* Demonstrates text preprocessing techniques
* Uses various classification algorithms
* Provides insights into cuisine trends and patterns

### 3. KDD: Spam Email Classification
This project utilizes the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham).
#### Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackksoncsie/spam-email-dataset
#### Medium Article: https://medium.com/@shubhamkothiya007/restaurant-cuisine-classification-a-data-science-approach-using-semma-methodology-4e65d1547aef
### Key Features:
* Implements text preprocessing and feature engineering
* Compares multiple classification algorithms
* Provides insights into effective spam detection techniques
